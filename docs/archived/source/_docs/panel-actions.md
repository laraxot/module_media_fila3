# Panel Actions {#panel-actions}

In Laravel, panel actions are functions or methods that can be used to perform specific tasks within the Laravel admin panel. These actions are usually associated with a specific model or resource, and can be used to perform operations such as creating, updating, deleting or viewing the model or resource.

Panel actions are typically used in the Laravel admin panel to provide users with quick and easy access to common tasks related to a particular model or resource. For example, a panel action might be used to quickly create a new user account, edit an existing user's details, or delete a user account that is no longer needed. Panel actions are typically implemented as buttons or links within the admin panel, and can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project.
